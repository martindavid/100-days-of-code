# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

Repository for logging my #100DaysOfCode journey.

## Contents
* [Rules](rules.md)
* [Log - click here to see my progress](log.md)
* [FAQ](FAQ.md)
* [Resources](resources.md)

## Rules:
1. Commit to the [Log](log.md) daily.
2. **Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.**
3. **Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward!**
4. **Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.**
6. Important: (see No.3 above for a specific rule on this) Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
