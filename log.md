### Day 4: October 13, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- Coding for my uni assignment
- Learn about UX design

**Thoughts** 

Break from my side project and focus on uni assignment. Interesting, when I flasback during this semester I `have` to learn 4 programming language at the same time, two of which literally force a different kind of thinking (declarative programming) -> Haskell and Prolog. Both are interesting and challenging language and worth to have some knowledge about it.

### Day 5: October 16, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- Try to reactify sb-admin-dashboard

**Thoughts** 

It's probably a good idea to start my own open-source project. Even though there are already many project outside like this, I want to make this as my learning media as well.

### Day 6: October 17, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- Integrate reactstrap library to my project (sb-admin-react)

**Thoughts** 

The project is awesome, and learn from the source code is useful to understand how to build a react component

### Day 7: October 19, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- Play around with react-router v4
- Finishing sidebar menu and header menu implementation

**Thoughts** 

- React-Router v4 makes me rethinking the way I setup my router, which different than what I used to.
- reactstrap component is really easy to use and learn from its source code is useful enough.
