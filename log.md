### Day 2: October 11, 2017
**Today's Progress**
Working on the same hackathon-starter project.
* Add bootstrap v4
* Add hot-reload for react code

**Thoughts** 

Today I spent time to learn about hot-reload in react and how it can be implemented. I also read bootstrap v4 documentation, feels excited to implement the new structure in bootstrap for this hackathon-starter.
