### Day 4: October 13, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- Coding for my uni assignment
- Learn about UX design

**Thoughts** 

Break from my side project and focus on uni assignment. Interesting, when I flasback during this semester I `have` to learn 4 programming language at the same time, two of which literally force a different kind of thinking (declarative programming) -> Haskell and Prolog. Both are interesting and challenging language and worth to have some knowledge about it.

### Day 5: October 16, 2017
**Today's Progress**
- Try to reactify sb-admin-dashboard

**Thoughts** 

It's probably a good idea to start my own open-source project. Even though there are already many project outside like this, I want to make this as my learning media as well.
